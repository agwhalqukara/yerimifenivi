Guards run to his side, and later images show how they began chest compressions in a vain attempt to revive him. He died several hours later in hospital from massive blood loss.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yamagami was tackled to the ground and arrested, with police saying he has confessed – telling them he wanted to kill Abe because he was a member of a ‘specific organisation’ that he disagreed with.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Police say&nbsp;Yamagami had amassed an arsenal of home-made weapons similar to the one used in the attack at his home, along with a number of explosives which have been taken to be destroyed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is not clear exactly how he learned to make the weapons, but&nbsp;he is a veteran of the country’s defence forces, having served in the navy between 2002 and 2005.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yamagami is currently unemployed and had travelled to Nara by train, lying in wait at the station where Mr Abe was due to give his speech before launching the attack.
